Rails app showing data from police.uk on specific locations ( 1m -radius).

##############

Street-level crimes

Crimes at street-level; either within a 1 mile radius of a single point, or within a custom area.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The street-level crimes returned in the API are only an approximation of where the actual crimes occurred, they are NOT the exact locations.

##############

The API provides a rich data source for information, including:

Neighbourhood team members
Upcoming events
Street-level crime and outcome data
Nearest police stations
The API is implemented as a standard JSON web service using HTTP GET and POST requests. Full request and response examples are provided in the documentation.
